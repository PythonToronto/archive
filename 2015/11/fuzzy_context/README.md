This are my notes for the talk I gave at @PythonToronto on November 18, 2015.

These are two pages of jupyter notebook, code samples along with the the language I used is Python 3.

There are no dependencies other then fuzzy-wuzzy and all jupiter dependencies; to install everything just run the following command in Python 3.4 environment
